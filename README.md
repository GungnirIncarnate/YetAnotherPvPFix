# YetAnotherPvPFix

Tired of having PvP break every single patch? This project aims to maintain PvP functionality without having to do complicated config adjustments like WorldOption.sav or other workarounds.

Does not rely on `bIsPvP` in PalWorldSettings.ini which breaks a lot of functionality like mounting and being unable to assign certain player status points. This mod uses its own config file in the mod's own folder called PVP-settings.ini where you can toggle both player and building damage individually.

# Installation

Installation is pretty straightforward, you'll need UE4SS and the mod itself goes into the Mods folder in either Win64/Mods or Win64/ue4ss/Mods depending on if you're on the most recent experimental version of UE4SS or not.

Note that this mod is intended for Dedicated Servers only and may not work in Co-Op (Invite Only sessions).
